# Instructions

Follow the steps below to create a new repository:

1. Customize the repository
   1. Click on the _Use this template_ button at the top of this page
   2. Clone the repository locally 
   3. Update the `README.md` and `pom.xml` with the new module information. Remember to update the `url` and `distributionManagement.repository.url` entries in the `pom.xml` with the actual name of the repository.
2. Setup Code Climate
   1. Add the project to [Croct's code climate organization](https://codeclimate.com/accounts/5e714648faaa9c00fb000081/dashboard)
   2. Go to **Repo Settings > Badges** and copy the maintainability and coverage badges to the `README.md` 
   3. Go to **Repo Settings > Test coverage** and copy the "_TEST REPORTER ID_"
   4. On the Github repository page, go to **Settings > Secrets** and add a secret with name `CODECLIMATE_TESTREPORTER_ID` and the ID from the previous step as value
3. Configure Apache Maven for use with GitHub Packages
   1. Copy `.gihub/settings.xml` to `~/.m2/settings.xml`
   2. Create a personal access token to authenticate with your username directly to GitHub Packages
         - Go to *GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token*
         - Generate a new token with `read:packages` scope
   3. Replace `${env.MAVEN_GITHUB_USER}` and `${env.MAVEN_GITHUB_TOKEN}` with your GitHub username and personal token, respectively
